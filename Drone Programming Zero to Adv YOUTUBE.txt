Introduction to Drone Programming Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4HeMhY_jI&list=PLWYeZ0NQDsoaIUAvUsE_6LEzy4G8H33Gb&index=12

2 years old- note that uses px4 vs px6

Waypoint navigation
Return to home
Follow Me
auto takeoff and landing
other autonomous features

Tools:
Ardupilot
Pixhawk
Ground Control Station (APM Planner, QGC, Mavproxy, other GCS)
Mavlink
DroneKit
Linux
Python
Socket Programming 


Drone System- 3 parts
UAV (DIFFERENT FROM JUST DRONE!!)
Drone Control Station 
Communication Link System

Break each down into Software, Hardware 
Also, software + firmware :O 

Drone- many subsystems. 
Only interested in flight controller- "Brain" of drone. This is where code will run!
Flight Controller makes calculation for commands! 

How do we know drone will run well??
Flight Dynamics Model of Drone!!! 
Simulation of drone in real world- test stability 

Ardupilot + SiTL (software in the loop)

Ground Control Station- Ground based hardware/software to communicate & control drone
Many available-
QGS (ios, linux)
Mavproxy(linux)
tower, mavpilot(tablet)

Communication Link system- telemetry
Software - socket communication *
nice. MAVLink protocol! 

Next, ardupilot API 
DroneKit!! 

What are ardupilot & pixhawk??

Ardupilot brief history
Chris Anderson 2007, founds DIY-Drones
Jordi 2008- Sparkfun competition
Chris & Jordi found 3D Robotics, first ardupilot code drops 2009
APM 1 released 2010

Pixhawk - CV Autonomous drone research by Lorenz (2008)_
He made drone & software himself with team of 14
2009- win EMAV competition. Team name: Pixhawk!
Released software as open source
Also developed Mavlink protocol- picked up by open source community. 
Also made QGroundControl for linux, windows 
2011- scrapped software and hardware of last 3 years, complete rebuild solved their issues
PX4 delivered the quality they wanted!
pre 2013- Company 3DR used to make ardupilot hardware, began to partner with Pixhawk
Last ardupilot: APM 2.5/2.6 in 2012

7 lakhs lines of code (700k) ardupilot

px4- 1.5 million lines of code 
Support many different vehicle types!

Cool features:
Autonomous mode!! 
Auto takeoff/landing
return to home
preprogrammed missions
follow person/follow me
accept commands from offboard computer/ GCS
Failsafe- low battery, RC loss, position loss, data link loss,
geofence breach, mission failsafe
DETECT AND AVOID!!


Part 3- a complete understanding of GCS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QggP5a5dYmk

PC/Mobile phone/ tablet can function as one 
Throttle, Pitch, Roll, Yaw
GCS: battery, position, altitute, direction, speed, etc 

Open source GCS
Mission Planner (Windows) *recommended
APM Planner 2
MAVProxy (Linux only)
QGroundControl(WIndows, Max, Linux, Android< Ios)
UGCS
Tablet/Smartphone:
Tower/Droidplanner 3
MAVpilot
Andropilot
SidePilot
surrou


Mission Planner installed!

Part 4- Mission Planner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmcthC0O2Q

Launch SITL, connect to mission planner
how to plan proper mission?
how to fly with gcs?
how to change simulation parameters?

simulation
model
plan
waypoints! 

Generally, use terrain based altitute, then relative. 
Waypoint method not proper, though. 
Plan in 5 phases
Takeoff
Climbing
Cruise
Descend
Landing

Cover under command 

Setting up environment for drone programming

Virtualbox? 
Program on linux!!
Ubuntu
Archlinux
